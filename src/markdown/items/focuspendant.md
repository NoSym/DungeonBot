**Focus Pendant**

Requires Attunement

You can concentrate on two spells at once. Concentration saves are made individually for each spell.
While concentrating on two spells the save DC for each spell increases by 1 for each level of the slot used to cast it.

i.e. Maintaining a 2nd and 3rd level spell would require DC 12 and DC 13 saves at minimum
