Requires Attunement
Holds 3 charges which replenish after a long rest

While holding this staff you may expend one charge to instantly travel up to 15 ft. in any direction as a bonus action.
The path must be unobstructed*.

*Unobstructed in this instance meaning that you could travel the same path with a flying speed of 15 ft.
i.e. You can't move through an enemy, or a space you wouldn't normally be able to fit through.
